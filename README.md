Associate Insights is a Teams Power App template designed to capture customer feedback and sentiment through First Line Workers in retail stores through the one on one direct connection with the customers. The feedback submitted through the app can then be used by business teams collaboratively within a Team using a PowerBI Teams tab to derive deep product and operational insights that can be used to improve the product and customer experience.

The potential app use cases are:

 - Empowering the First Line Workers to provide feedback.
 - Utilizing the direct connection between the First Line Workers and the customers to learn about the customer feedback and sentiment.

Currently Associate Insights app has a single page experience with fields and field headers which can be completely customized as per business need.
